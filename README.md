# .dotfiles

Inspired by the [multitude of other people who have done this before](https://github.com/topics/dotfiles), I've started collecting various config files in an effort to standardize my setups across computers. Plus it will (hopefully!) make it a little easier to move my preferences to a new machine when I need to.

Feel free us use whatever you'd like, but I'd recommend that you don't just straight-up use these files as they are; just because thery work for me, doesn't mean that they will work for you (or at all!), or -- more importantly -- match your preferences.
